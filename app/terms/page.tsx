      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-white mb-4">
        <li>Don't summon mythological creatures to attack our servers.</li>
        <li>
          Respect other users and their opinions. Even if they think Norse
          mythology is better than Greek.
        </li>
        <li>Have fun and enjoy the wealth of information we provide!</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-white">
        Failure to comply with these terms may result in a visit from an angry
        Minotaur. Just kidding, but please play nice!
